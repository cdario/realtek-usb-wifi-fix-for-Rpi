# An idiot's guide to RTL8188CUS wifi adapter setup - (the idiot is me of course - MrEngman)

# What an idiot, why am I doing this? It's just asking for trouble.

# Update: 22/05/2012 - It is now not necessary to edit the script to add the network SSID 
# and PASSWORD. When the script is run will ask you to input them when required.

# Update: 25/05/2012 - I have added an option to enable the wifi adapter to be hotpluggable.
# i.e. you can remove the adapter while the Pi is powered on and then plug it back in later
# and the wifi will automatically re-install and reconnect to the wireless network.

# Update: 28/05/2012 - Minor change to ensure the wifi is detected as connected and not the
# wired network if a wired network cable is plugged in as well.

# Update: 31/05/2012 - Minor change to disable automatically running rpi-update. Running 
# rpi-update recently has caused problems and kills the wifi. You can run rpi-update if you
# want to but it may cause problems so be warned.

# Update: 08/06/2012 - Major update. I have compiled a new driver for the RTL8188CUS. The 
# script will now run with or without an ethernet connection. It will determine if the 
# ethernet is connected and if it is will use the internet to download any files needed. It 
# will then install the new wifi driver which handles the current updates to the RPi 
# firmware and software downloaded by rpi-update.
# If there is no internet connection the script will proceed as before and install the 
# original drivers that must first be copied to the SD card before running it in the RPi. 
# The apt-get updates and upgrades will be loaded and rpi-update will be run to update the 
# RPi firmware and software. Finally the latest wifi driver will be installed to handle the 
# new updates. And finally RPi will reboot to enable the new driver.

# Update: 17/06/2012 - Updated driver to take care of latest rpi-updates.

# Update: 22/06/2012 - Updated driver to remove debug output.

# Update: 24/06/2012 - Added options to allow installation for unsecured, WEP and WPA/WPA2 
# secured networks. The DHCP update is now also optional. And only change apt-get 
# sources.list for debian6-19-04-2012 version. The latest version of the script has now been 
# renamed install-rtl8192cu-latest.sh. The latest version of the tared driver has been 
# renamed 8192cu-latest.tar.gz. This avoids having to check for any different names as 
# code is changed or updated. Pointers to these files are on the Raspberry Pi wiki at 
# http://elinux.org/RPi_VerifiedPeripherals#Working_USB_Wifi_Adapters. Look for 
# Micronet SP907NS, 11N Wireless LAN USB Adapter.

# Update: 29/06/2012 - Updated driver to sdd USB ID to enable Netgear WNA1000M.

# Update: 01/07/2012 - Updated driver to take care of latest rpi-updates

# Update: 05/07/2012 - Updated driver/linux version list to add #149 PREEMPT

# Update: 17/07/2012 - Major update. The script should now be able to install the rtl8188cus 
# wifi driver on the following Linux versions. Debian6-19-04-2012, 2012-06-18-wheezy-beta, 
# raspbian hexxeh R3, raspbian pisces+mate R1, raspbian pisces R1, raspbian pisces R2, 
# raspbian pisces R3 and raspbian_wheezy_20120608 (darkbasic). It has not been used with any 
# other images.
# The script will install the wifi adapter on an SD card with a newly installed image or on 
# one that has been updated using rpi-update or some other method. It will also update the 
# wifi driver on an SD that already has the wifi driver installed. This will enable the SD 
# card to be updated and the new driver will be installed or it can be used to repair an SD 
# card that had a working wifi but was then broken after a linux version update. It will 
# also install the driver on an SD card that already has a different wifi adapter installed 
# or will add another wifi adapter using the rtl8188cus chip.
# The script will allow the wifi to be installed on a Pi that has no internet connection but
# this will require the driver and possibly a number of additional files to be copied to the
# SD card before starting the installation depending on the version of image being used. To
# install on a Pi with a wired internet connection only the script is required.

# Update: 08/08/2012 - Updated to be able to use the script to add/update the wifi driver on 
#  XBian

# Update: 13/08/2012 - Added test to ensure script run by root. Added test to collect list of 
# nearby wireless networks to check network has visible SSID available.

# Update: 19/08/2012 - Update for new wheezy version. Fixed bugs that put driver in wrong 
# directory.

# Update: 25/08/2012 - New driver for 3.2.27+ #66 PREEMPT

# Update: 30/08/2012 - New driver for 3.2.27+ #90 PREEMPT. Removed adding additional firmware 
# for original Debian6-19-04-2012 image as it appears to be irrelevant. The firmware is not 
# actually needed to get the wifi running - now where did those instructions first appear?
# Various additions to the instructions - updates/additions to script operation and info on
# copying files to the SD card if required.

# Update: 05/09/2012 - Updated script to handle new build in driver.

# Update: 10/09/2012 - Updated the script to avoid having to hot-plug the wifi adapter
# to avoid kernel crashes when plugging the wifi adapter while the Pi is powere on.

# Update: 14/09/2012 - Updated the script to avoid conflicts when using apt-get upgrade and
# rpi-update. Running rpi-update before apt-get upgrade can result in apt-get upgrade 
# loading an older kernel version which has caused problems restoring a working driver.

Introduction:
-------------

This document is intended to tell you how you can use the installation script to configure 
your Pi to use a wifi adapter based on the Realtek RTL8188CUS wifi chip to enable it to
connect to the internet over a wireless network.

These instructions are available at http://dl.dropbox.com/u/80256631/install-rtl8188cus.txt
They get updated occasionally so may be worth downloading again if you haven't done so for a while.

The installation script is available at http://dl.dropbox.com/u/80256631/install-rtl8188cus-latest.sh

If you already have the script install-rtl8188cus.sh download the script from the link above 
and use that one.

The script, a batch file in Windows speak, will install the rtl8188cus driver either on a 
new Linux image, an image that has been upgraded using apt-get, rpi-update or some other 
method, or an image that already has a wifi adapter installed but uses some other driver. It 
can also be used to update the driver and software/firmware on an image or add an additional 
wifi adapter to an image that already has a wifi adapter installed that uses the rtl8188cus 
driver.

The script can install the driver on a Pi that has no internet connection or on a Pi that 
already has an internet connection, either using a wired LAN connection or another wifi 
adapter.

The easiest way to install the driver is if the Pi has some form of internet access using 
either a LAN connection or wifi connection. However, an internet connection is not a 
necessary requirement and the basic installation can be done without the Pi having internet 
access. If the Pi has no internet access you will need some other system with access to the 
internet so you can download the files needed to complete the wifi driver installation. Once 
the driver is loaded the wifi adapter will provide the Pi with internet access and any files 
needed later in the installation will be downloaded over the wifi network. If you can 
connect your Pi to a network with access to the internet then the only file you need to 
download is the script. Any other files needed will be downloaded from the internet by the 
script when needed.

The script can also be run on an image that already has the rtl8188cus driver installed to 
allow it to be upgraded to the latest version compatible with the installed Linux version. 
Also if your image has the rtl8188cus driver installed and the wifi has stopped working 
because you have done a software upgrade you can run the script to repair/upgrade the broken 
driver. 

The script will also allow you to add additional wifi adapters to an image that already has 
one or more already installed. The installed adapter may use a different driver or the 
rtl8188cus driver. The script will add the new adapter and assign a unique wlan number to 
the new adapter. You will then be able to change the connected wifi adapters if you want 
to or even connect more than one at the same time.

There have been a lot of discussions on the Raspberry Pi forums, and some are still ongoing, 
about power supplies, Wifi adapters using too much current, and various related topics. Go 
take a look at the forums to read more on these issues. With regard to the issues being 
discussed about power supplies, to begin with it may be sensible to use a powered hub to 
attach your wireless adapter to the Pi if you have one. Once the wireless is up and running 
then you can always remove it from the hub and try it connected straight into one of the 
Pi's USB ports. I have tried my wifi adapter plugged into a powered hub and also directly 
into one of the Pi's USB ports and have had no serious issue with either configuration, but 
I do have a reasonably hefty PSU.

The initial installation does not require the Pi to be connected to the internet so you do 
not need to worry about using or needing a wired network cable, however, the latter parts of 
the installation do require access to the internet but by that time your Pi should have a 
working wifi adapter and that will give you the necessary internet access.

The script will determine if you have an internet connection and will download all the files 
necessary to install the wifi and other updates/upgrades if you do. If you do have an internet 
connection available to your Pi you don't need to copy any files to the SD card before booting 
up the RPi. You can download the script to the Pi from the internet.

If the Pi doesn't have an internet connection the files needed to install the basic driver 
will need to be copied to the SD card before the installation can be completed. If you run 
the script and any files needed are not found the script will output a list of the missing 
files.

I have tested the script with the following images:

	2012-08-16-wheezy-raspbian
	2012-08-08-wheezy-armel
	2012-07-15-wheezy-raspbian
	raspbian pisces R1
	raspbian pisces R2
	raspbian pisces R3
	raspbian pisces+Mate R1
	raspbian hexxeh R3
	raspbian_wheezy_20120608 (Darkbasic)
	2012-06-18-wheezy-beta
	2012_06_10_spindle_wheezy_public_alpha
	debian6-19-04-2012


A list of files needed to install the driver on each of the listed images, if you don't have 
an internet connection to your Pi, is at the end of this document.

I have run the script many times on all the images I have tested it with. It works for me 
very well with the devices I use, the Micronet Wireless LAN USB Adapter Model No: SP907NS 
and the Edimax EW-7811Un even when plugged directly into one of the Pi's USB ports. 
Unfortunately I cannot guarantee this for everyone. 

So let's start ...



How to find out if your wifi adapter uses a Realtek RTL8188CUS wireless chip:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can look at the documentation that came with your wifi adapter but I'm not sure it will 
tell you anything useful. My adapter came with a CD with drivers, various PDF documents and 
other stuff but I didn't find any information about the chip type. Maybe I just didn't look 
hard enough, I don't know. Anyway I don't really care now as it is all working really well.

Here is a short list of devices from various manufacturers I have found that use the RTL8188CUS:

If you have one of these there's a good chance my installation will get your adapter up and 
running. If you cannot identify your device and it is not in the list you can find out the ID 
by reading on.

If you have another Linux machine then you may be able to use that but I and many others 
have found Linux systems, especially the Pi with Debian software, may hang when inserting 
this type of wifi adapter if the driver is not already installed. You can try though. Plug 
your wifi adapter into a USB  port and enter the command lsusb. This command is used to 
list the USB devices connected to your system. There will probably be a short delay and then 
if all goes well this will generate a list of USB devices and show the details of your 
device. If you already have another Linux machine then you are probably fairly well up with 
Linux and already know enough to set the adapter up yourself.

For an RTL8188CUS chip you should see something like:

BUS 001 Device 004: ID 0bda:8176 Realtek Semiconductor Corp. RTL8188CUS 802.11n WLAN

or one of the other identifiers listed above. This is not a definitive list and there are
many other devices using the RTL8188CUS chip.


If you have a Windows system of some sort proceed as follows. Insert the adapter into a USB 
port. Windows will try to load a driver for it. When that has finished open "Control Panel" 
and select "Device Manager". Look in the "Network Adapters" section and you should see the 
adapter listed. On my Windows 7 system it shows up as a "Realtek RTL8188CU Wireless LAN 
802.11n USB 2.0 Network Adaptor". 

Note this says "RTL8188CU" seems an "S" is missing. To make sure it really is an 
"RTL8188CUS" select the adapter and right click and open "Properties". Select "Details", 
open the "Property" list and select "Hardware Ids". This will then show something like:

USB\VID_0BDA&PID_8176&REV_0200
USB\VID_0BDA&PID_8176

The VID=0BDA, PID=8176 (0BDA:8176) identifies the device as an RTL8188CUS.

So, the important information is the device ID (VID/PID) which in my case is 0bda:8176. 
This identifies the adapter is an RTL8188CUS chip.

To use the rtl8188cus driver your device's ID must match one in the VID/PID list above. 
If it is not based on the RTL8188CUS then unfortunately I cannot help further.

If your device does match one from the list above then continue on. Bear in mind that I am 
using a Micronet Wireless LAN USB Adapter Model No: SP907NS and Edimax EW-7811Un. If you 
have one of these I would expect it to work but cannot guarantee this. If you have another 
manufacturer's wifi adapter based on the RTL8188CUS then I would also expect it to work but 
again it may not. There could be minor hardware differences, for example, which is why they 
have adopted a different device ID to the original Realtek ID. This could cause hiccups in 
the driver which may stop it from functioning correctly.


Initialising your first SD card:
--------------------------------

There is plenty of information on the Raspberry Pi wiki about initialising your SD card. 
Take a look at the Raspberry Pi wiki at http://elinux.org/RPi_Easy_SD_Card_Setup and view 
the section "Copying the image to an SD Card on Windows" if you normally use a Windows 
system.

Initialise your SD using the instructions on the wiki but stop after step 9. You may need 
to copy the script and some additional files to the SD card before bringing up the Pi.


If your Pi has NO internet connection:-

To configure the SD card to run the script for the wifi adapter without an internet 
connection to the RPi you will need to download the script and some additional files. The 
files you need will vary depending on the image you are using. There is a list images and 
the files needed for each one at the end of this document. You will need to download the 
files and copy them and the script to the /boot directory of SD card.

Insert the SD card back into the card reader. If you used a Windows sytem to generate the SD 
card image use Windows Explorer to view the SD card. The SD card will show in Windows as a 
disk with a folder of about 74-75MB. The remainder of the SD card uses Linux partitions that 
do not show up in Windows, and if the SD card is bigger than 2GB much of the card will be 
unused which will also not show up in Windows. So do not worry about the size you see.

Now copy the script and the files you need to the SD drive. Once they are copied over to the 
SD card you can eject the card from the card reader.


If your Pi DOES have an internet connection, wired or wireless:-

You not need to copy any files to the SD card before running the Pi. Once the Pi is up and 
running you will need to download one file, the script. Any remain files needed will be 
downloaded from the internet by the script when it is running. 


PLEASE NOTE: If you copy the image to the SD card using windd (windows dd) be careful about 
where you store the image you are going to copy. Make sure there are no space characters in 
the file path or dd will fail to copy the image correctly.

If the SD card you intend using is bigger than 2GB it is a very good idea to re-partition 
it, i.e. expand the space to store the software and make it fill the whole SD card, so you 
can use the whole disk capacity otherwise it is rather a waste as a part of the SD card will 
be unusable and you may find you run out of space fairly quickly. Some images will 
automatically resize themselves when first run. Refer to the documentation for the image you 
are using.

To resize partitions I use 

gparted live 

This can be found at http://gparted.sourceforge.net/livecd.php. gparted live is a CD ISO image. 
This needs writing to a CD. gparted is then run by inserting it into the CD drive on your 
system and booting from the CD. 

If your SD card is bigger than 2GB I would certainly recommend re-partitioning it. With the 
size of the updates and upgrades increasing rapidly I would now suggest re-partitioning the 
SD card before unning the wifi installation.

A couple of things I've noticed about using Win32DiskImager. I normally use a USB card 
reader to plug my SD card into. If I start Win32DiskImager before the card is plugged into 
the card reader Win32DiskImager will not see it when I plug the SD card into the card 
reader. The card  must be plugged into the card reader before I start Win32DiskImager. On 
the other hand if I use the built in SD card slot on my laptop then I can start 
win32DiskImager before the SD card is plugged in and when I plug in the SD card 
Win32DiskImager will detect it automatically. Strange ;) Other people have reported that 
Win32DiskImager will not see the SD card at all if it plugged directly into an SD card 
reader but that they need to use aUSB connected SD card reader.


Before running the script you need to determine three items, your wireless network name - 
the SSID, the network password - Network Security Key as it is known in Windows 7 and the 
type of security the network uses, if any. e.g unsecured, WEP or WPA/WPA2.

When the script runs it will ask you the type of security used and to input the SSID, and 
if your network uses WEP or WPA/WPA2, the PASSWORD when they are required.

IMPORTANT: The SSID, security mode and PASSWORD must match those used by your wireless 
network. If they do not the Pi will not connect to your wireless network and the 
installation script will fail. You will need to start back from the beginning and re-write 
your SD card with the software image and re-copy the driver files. You must use the correct 
SSID, security mode and PASSWORD.

The script will ask you to verify the SSID and PASSWORD are correct before using them in the 
installation.
 
After you have copied the files to the SD card it is ready to be plugged into the Pi. If you 
are adding a new wifi adapter - DO NOT PLUG IN THE WIFI ADAPTER UNTIL ASKED TO.



Installing your rtl8188cus wireless adapter:
--------------------------------------------


If you are installing your first wifi adapter or adding a new wifi adapter to a Pi that 
already has a different one installed the driver should be installed BEFORE plugging in the 
new wifi adapter.

DO NOT PLUG IN THE WIFI ADAPTER UNTIL ASKED TO - LOOK AT THE SCREEN OUTPUT FOR INSTRUCTIONS.

So connect up your Pi then power on and wait for it to boot and initialise. Log in and then 
you can start to install the software/firmware for the wifi adapter.

Some images need configuring when they are first run so go through the configuration before 
running the sript. After the image is configured you can start the script to install the wifi. 

If you have an internet connection to your Pi you can now download the script. Use the
command:

sudo wget http://dl.dropbox.com/u/80256631/install-rtl8188cus-latest.sh -O /boot/install-rtl8188cus-latest.sh

This will install the script in the /boot directory of the SD card ready to run.


If you are NOT logged in as root start the script using the command:

sudo /boot/install-rtl8188cus-latest.sh

If you are logged in as root use the command:

/boot/install-rtl8188cus-latest.sh (no sudo!)

If you are connected to the Pi using ssh, and not logged in as root user then you may need 
to use the command

sudo bash /boot/install-rtl8188cus-latest.sh 

or if logged in as the root user.

bash /boot/install-rtl8188cus-latest.sh 

The script should now start running. I have written the script so it will output messages to 
the screen so you can see what it is doing as a lot of the time there is no output to the 
display.

If you have not used the script before it will make an update to the kernel configuration
to allow you to run with the wifi adapter plugged in before the driver is loaded. This
configuration change will disable a built in driver that does not work and causes problems
if the wifi adapter is plugged in before the working driver is installed. After making the
change it will shutdown the Pi. You can then plug in the wifi adapter and power on again 
and thePi should run without problems. You can then run the acript to install the wifi
driver and configure the wifi.

At the beginning of the installation the script will make several checks. It will check if 
you have an internet connection, wired or wireless, and you have access to the internet. It 
will try and determine if you already have a wifi adapter configured.

If you do not have an internet connection to your Pi it will check it has all the necessary 
files to install and run the wifi driver. If it does not have all the files it needs it will 
output a list of files it does not have and will abort the installation. You will have to 
download the files it requires and copy them to the /boot directory of the SD card and 
restart the script.

For some images it may be necessary to install some additional applications to allow the 
wifi to operate correctly. The script will install these before configuring and installing 
the wifi driver. If your Pi doesn't have an internet connection and these files are not 
copied to the SD card the script will list the files it needs and then abort. You will need 
to download and copy these files to the /boot directory of the image.

To copy missing files to the Pi there are basically two ways to do it. You can shutdown the 
Pi, remove the SD card and plug it into the computer used to generate the image in the first 
place. Then download the missing files on that computer and copy them to the SD card. 

Alternatively you can download the files needed on another computer with internet access and 
then copy them to a USB stick. You can then install the USB stick in the Pi and copy them from 
the USB stick to the SD card. To copy files to the /boot directory you will need to run the 
commands as root user. As I understand it a USB stick would normally be automatically mounted
in the directory /media. The command

ls /media 

should then show the device name. You can then copy the files using the command format 

sudo cp /media/device-name/filename /boot

I have, however, found that devices are not always mounted automatically so you must first 
mount the device manually. Using the command 

sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt 

will mount the device in the /mnt directory rather than /media. The files can then be displayed 
with the command 

ls /mnt
 
You can then copy the files using the command format 

sudo cp /mnt/filename /boot 

When finished copying the necessary files do not forget to unmount the USB stick - 

sudo umount /dev/sda1

Once all the files are copied to the SD card restart the script. It will again check all the 
files needed are available on the SD card and then start the install. 

If you already have a wifi adapter installed it will ask if you want to update the driver or 
add a new wifi adapter. If you are using an image that already has the rtl8188cus driver 
installed and it no longer works because you have made a software update you can update the 
driver to repair the driver installation. If a wifi driver is already installed, either 
using a different driver or the rtl8188cus driver, you can add another wifi adapter. You can 
then use either adapter or even use both. You can use this option to install a new wifi 
adapter if you don't want to use your old adapter, although the Pi will still be configured 
to run the older adapter if necessary.

After the driver and any other files needed are installed the script will then configure the 
files needed to use the wifi. It will first ask you the type of security the network uses if 
any. eg unsecured, WEP or WPA/WPA2. It uses this to determine some of the settings needed 
for the installation and whether you need to input a PASSWORD. The script will not ask for a 
password if you selected unsecured as the network security.

The script will then ask you to input the network SSID and a PASSWORD if it is required. 
Type in the SSID and then the PASSWORD. These values will be copied to the file 
/etc/network/interfaces as part of the setup. When inputting the SSID and PASSWORD the 
script will ask you to verify that they are correct before using then.

A recent addition to the script is a check to see if the wifi network you want to connect to 
is visible by the wifi adapter - that is it is transmitting it's ssid. With the basic setup 
used by the script a wifi adapter will not be able to connect to a network that does not 
transmit it's ssid. When the script gets to the point where it asks for the ssid of the 
network you want to connect to it will check the name is in this list. If it is not it will 
let you know. To get a connection you should reconfigure your wireless network to transmit 
the ssid.

Once the SSID and PASSWORD have been input and verified OK the remaining files will be 
configured to ensure the driver module is automatically loaded whenever the Pi is restarted.

The wifi driver should now be installed and configured. The script will output a message 
asking you to plug in the wifi adapter. Plug in the wifi adapter and press any key to 
continue.

It will wait for the wifi to connect then output some information about the network 
connection. It will show details on the wireless setup and should show you the IP address 
assigned to the wireless adapter. You can terminate the installation at this point by 
pressing Cntl-C.

If you do not terminate the script it will then continue on and update the software packages 
list and upgrade the installed software packages. This can take a long time especially if 
you are using any of the older images.

The script will then install rpi-update if it is not already installed. The rpi-update 
script, developed by Hexxeh, updates the Pi firmware/software.

The script will now check if the driver that is loaded is the latest available or not. If 
the installed driver is the latest the script will terminate and the wifi should be working. 

If the driver is not the latest version rpi-update will be run to update the Pi's 
firmware/software and then the final stage of the installation is to update the wifi driver 
to the latest version. 

If rpi-update is run by the script when the script terminates the Pi will reboot. If rpi-
update does not run the script will just terminate and you can continue to use the Pi.

When it has rebooted, login - AND START TO HAVE SOME FUN.

     HAVE FUN WITH YOUR RASPBERRY PI.



Possible problems:
------------------

If the script gets stuck at some point you should be able to terminate the script by 
pressing Cntl-C. However, please be careful using this option. Some events can take some 
time to complete even if there appears to be no activity. As an example I have seen rpi-update 
take almost 20 minutes to complete an update. During this time there was no output to the 
screen and little activiy from the LEDs.

Waiting for the wifi to connect after completing the install can also take rather longer than
might be expected the first time around.

I have occasionally seen problems when running the script. It may get stuck when updating 
the packages list or the installed software packages. The commands to download the package 
list or the updates may fail to access the download site and may get stuck and loop 
continuously. In this situation I have generally been able to recover by terminating the 
script using Cntl-C and then re-running the script and selecting the Update option.

I have also on a couple of occasions had the kernel crash while the package updates have 
been running. Again I have been able to recover by re-running the script and selecting the 
Upgrade option.

Images and associated files needed to install the driver if you have no internet connection 
to your Pi. If you have updated your image with apt-get or rpi-update the files needed will
probably be different. If you run the script it will tell you what files it needs if you
have not already copied them to the SD card.
